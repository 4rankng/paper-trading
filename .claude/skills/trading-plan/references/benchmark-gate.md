# Entry Benchmark Gate

**Rule:** Fail more than 1 test → REJECTED (BUY INDEX)

## The 6 Rigorous Tests

| Test | Question | Passing Criteria | Fail Action |
|------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Q1: Alpha Source** | Can I explain the "edge" in 2 sentences without using "potential"? | Specific, defensible advantage (e.g., "30% cost advantage from Y patent") | BUY INDEX |
| **Q2: Relative Strength** | Ticker outperforming its sector (XLK, XBI, etc.) over 3M? | Beating sector ETF | BUY INDEX |
| **Q3: Institutional Footprint** | Is "Big Money" buying? | Rising institutional ownership OR weekly volume accumulation | BUY INDEX |
| **Q4: The "Anti-Catalyst"** | Major event (Earnings, FDA, Fed) in next 10 days? | Clear 10-day catalyst runway | BUY INDEX |
| **Q5: Expectation Gap** | Is market "leaning" too hard one way? | Social media sentiment NOT overheated (>80%) | BUY INDEX |
| **Q6: Exit Math** | Is Reward-to-Risk ≥ 3:1 based on hard resistance vs stop? | R:R ≥ 3:1 | BUY INDEX |

## Gate Result

- **PASS (≤1 failure)** → BUY STOCK
- **REJECT (≥2 failures)** → BUY INDEX
