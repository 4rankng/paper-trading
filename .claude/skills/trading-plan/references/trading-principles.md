# Trading & Entry Principles

**Flexible Discipline > Rigid Anchoring**

1. **Breakout Confirmation**
In strong secular trends, a breakout +5% on 2x+ volume overrides pullback waiting. Enter breakout or wait for retest of breakout level, not old support.

2. **Supply Chain Data Hierarchy**
Channel checks with specific quantifiable claims ("sold out 2026," "10-15% price increase") are facts, not opinions. Treat as fundamental upgrades, not sentiment noise.

3. **Low ADX Re-interpretation**
ADX < 20 + Price above MA200 + Holding near highs = Accumulation (compressed energy), not drift. Look at volume profile, not just ADX.

4. **Entry Zone Flexibility (Bidirectional)**
If price moves +/-5% past your entry zone, re-run checklist:
- UPSIDE (+5%): Thesis strengthened? Enter smaller size. Just noise? Wait retest of NEW level.
- DOWNSIDE (-5%): Thesis intact? Add to position. Thesis broken? Abort entirely.
Never refuse to pay up due to ego—only if R:R actually broke. Never chase falling knives.

5. **Scarcity Premium**
In crowded secular trends, the #2 player trades at a discount to #1 until scarcity value appears. When market realizes "only 2 games in town," #2 gets a scarcity bump not captured in traditional valuation.

6. **Catalyst Clustering**
3+ catalysts within 60 days = acceleration phase, not accumulation. Enter on first confirmation, don't wait for perfect setup.

7. **Momentum Look-Forward**
When laggard stock reversals on 1.5x+ volume closing near highs, old relative strength chart is broken. New regime starts at reversal candle.

8. **Sector Catalyst Check**
When a stock shows unusual strength despite "bad" fundamentals, ALWAYS check sector-wide catalysts:
- Mega-IPOs in sector (investors buy proxies of what they can't access)
- Peer group movement (are sector peers moving together?)
- ETF flows and rebalancing
- Regulatory/policy shifts affecting entire sector
- M&A activity or consolidation rumors

A sector re-rating can override individual stock fundamentals. Don't analyze in isolation.

9. **Mean Reversion Gate (Conditional)**
Relative strength test is CONDITIONAL on phenomenon type:
- HYPE_MACHINE: Require beating sector (momentum confirmation)
- MEAN_REVERSION: Require UNDERPERFORMING sector (contrarian indicator)
- EARNINGS_MACHINE: Neutral (fundamentals dominate)
- TURNAROUND: Neutral to positive (improvement is key)

A stock that's underperformed is MORE likely to mean revert, not less. Don't penalize the condition that creates the opportunity.

10. **Stop-First Rule**
Define stop loss BEFORE entry, not after. If you can't articulate the exact price that invalidates your thesis, you don't have a trade. Stops are thesis-validation points, not risk management afterthoughts.

11. **Post-Run Caution**
After a 100%+ run in <12 months, "consolidation" is often early-stage distribution. Be wary of buying breakouts from extended bases—what looks like healthy basing can be the calm before deeper correction. Favor pullbacks to dynamic support (MA-50/100) over breakouts to new highs.
