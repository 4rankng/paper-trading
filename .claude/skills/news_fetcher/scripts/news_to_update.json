But Fed Chairman Jay Powell\u2019s term expires in May 2026 and a potential new chair may result in some uncertainty.\n\nGiven the expected path of Fed policy, we see opportunities for investors in the belly of the yield curve, managing interest rate risk with bond laddering and seeking higher income outside of core bonds.\n"
