## Executive Summary
- Key stats (alpha, volatility, catalysts)
- Phenomenon classification
- Investment thesis summary (2-sentence "edge")

## Phenomenon Classification
- **Primary Driver:** (HYPE_MACHINE / EARNINGS_MACHINE / MEAN_REVERSION_MACHINE)
- **Evidence:** Why this classification applies
- **Why Not the Other Machine Type:** Explicit falsification
- **Timeframe:** 6-month (Hype) / 3-year+ (Earnings) / Variable (Mean-Reversion)

## Multi-Agent Debate
- **Bull Case** (3-5 points): Fundamental strengths, catalysts, market inefficiency
- **Bear Case** (3-5 points): Fundamental weaknesses, risks, why market is right
- **Synthesis:** Evidence weight, invalidation triggers, confidence adjustment

## Pre-Mortem Analysis (Critical)
*Pretend it's 6 months later and this trade hit stop-loss. Work backward.*

**Agent A (Macro):** "The trade failed because..."
- Example: Fed hiked rates unexpectedly, killing growth multiple
- Example: Sector rotated out of favor due to regime change

**Agent B (Specific):** "The trade failed because..."
- Example: Competitor launched v2.0 making this tech obsolete
- Example: Key executive departed, thesis collapsed

**Agent C (Technical/Flow):** "The trade failed because..."
- Example: Liquidity dried up, couldn't exit without slippage
- Example: Retail sentiment collapsed before earnings

## Entry Benchmark Gate (6 Rigorous Tests)
*Fail more than 1 test → REJECTED*

| Test | Question | Passing Criteria | Result |
|------|----------|------------------|--------|
| Q1: Alpha Source | Can I explain the "edge" in 2 sentences without using "potential"? | Specific, defensible advantage (e.g., "30% cost advantage from Y patent") | PASS/FAIL |
| Q2: Relative Strength | Ticker outperforming its sector (XLK, XBI, etc.) over 3M? | Beating sector ETF | PASS/FAIL |
| Q3: Institutional Footprint | Is "Big Money" buying? | Rising institutional ownership OR weekly volume accumulation | PASS/FAIL |
| Q4: The "Anti-Catalyst" | Major event (Earnings, FDA, Fed) in next 10 days? | Clear 10-day catalyst runway | PASS/FAIL |
| Q5: Expectation Gap | Is market "leaning" too hard one way? | Social media sentiment NOT overheated (>80%) | PASS/FAIL |
| Q6: Exit Math | Is Reward-to-Risk ≥ 3:1 based on hard resistance vs stop? | R:R ≥ 3:1 | PASS/FAIL |

**Gate Result:** [PASS (≤1 failure) / REJECT (≥2 failures)]

### Kill Switch Table (The "I Was Wrong" Triggers)
*If ANY of these occur, close position immediately, no questions asked.*

| Trigger | Condition | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Fundamental Kill | Revenue growth drops below X% OR key metric Y degrades | CLOSE 100% |
| Technical Kill | Price breaks [support level] on [volume] | CLOSE 100% |
| Thesis Kill | [Specific catalyst] fails OR [key executive] departs | CLOSE 100% |
| Time Kill | Thesis not validated by [date] | CLOSE 100% |

## Catalyst Timeline
- **Near-term (0-3M):** Specific events, earnings, data points
- **Mid-term (3-6M):** Milestones, product launches, market validation
- **Long-term (6M+):** Full thesis realization, convergence

## Risk Management (Enhanced)
- **Max Drawdown Allowed:** $X,XXX or Y% loss
- **Liquidity Profile:**
  - Average Daily Volume (ADV): $X M
