## Portfolio Management Principles

### Selling and Position Sizing

1. **Never recommend trimming or selling a holding unless the investment thesis is in WARNING or DANGER status.**
   - Portfolio concentration concerns alone do not justify selling a healthy thesis
   - Focus on thesis integrity, not mechanical portfolio metrics

2. **Thesis Status Classification:**
   - **PENDING** - Early stage, validation required
   - **VALIDATING** - Catalysts progressing, evidence accumulating
   - **STRONGER** - Thesis strengthening with new evidence
   - **WARNING** - Thesis at risk, monitor closely
   - **DANGER** - Thesis failing or invalidated

3. **Invalidation Signals (thesis danger):**
   - Partnership cancellations or failed deployments
   - Regulatory setbacks that block core business
   - Competitive breakthrough that negates differentiation
   - Management misconduct or accounting irregularities
   - Product launch failures or technological obsolescence
   - Major catalysts delayed or cancelled without explanation

4. **NOT Invalidation (thesis intact):**
   - Technical weakness (price below moving averages)
   - Insider selling (early investors taking profits)
   - Analyst downgrades (timeline extensions, not thesis breaks)
   - Portfolio concentration (mechanical metric)
   - Short-term volatility or sentiment swings
